# ðŸ”‹ E-Waste Detection System

This is a **real-time E-Waste Detection System** built with **Streamlit**, **YOLOv8** object detection, and a **TensorFlow classification model**. It can detect and classify e-waste items from **uploaded images** or **live webcam feed**.

The system is optimized for **continuous real-time detection** and ignores **people in the frame**. Detected objects are displayed with **bounding boxes, classification labels, and confidence scores**.

---

## Features

* âœ… **Upload Image Detection:** Detect and classify e-waste items in any uploaded image.
* âœ… **Continuous Webcam Detection:** Real-time detection using your webcam.
* âœ… **Person Detection Ignored:** The system does not classify or highlight humans.
* âœ… **Classification in Bounding Boxes:** Shows predicted class + confidence on detected objects.
* âœ… **Live Detection Panel:** See a live summary of detected objects and their types.
* âœ… **Capture Frame:** Save any frame from the webcam feed with predictions.
* âœ… **Hugging Face Integration:** Models and class files are downloaded directly from Hugging Face.
