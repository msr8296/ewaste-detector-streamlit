ðŸ”‹ E-Waste Detection System

This is a real-time E-Waste Detection System built with Streamlit, YOLOv8 object detection, and a TensorFlow classification model. It can detect and classify e-waste items from uploaded images or live webcam feed.

The system is optimized for continuous real-time detection and ignores people in the frame. Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes, classification labels, and confidence scores.

Features

âœ… Upload Image Detection: Detect and classify e-waste items in any uploaded image.

âœ… Continuous Webcam Detection: Real-time detection using your webcam.

âœ… Person Detection Ignored: The system does not classify or highlight humans.

âœ… Classification in Bounding Boxes: Shows predicted class + confidence on detected objects.

âœ… Live Detection Panel: See a live summary of detected objects and their types.

âœ… Capture Frame: Save any frame from the webcam feed with predictions.

âœ… Hugging Face Integration: Models and class files are downloaded directly from Hugging Face.
